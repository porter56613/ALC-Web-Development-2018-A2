                This is gonna be a happy little seascape. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You're meant to have fun in life. Imagination is the key to painting. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Every day I learn. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. You are only limited by your imagination. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. We'll play with clouds today. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun We need dark in order to show light. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.
