                We'll make some happy little bushes here. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Just make little strokes like that. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Just beat the devil out of it. See there how easy that is. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Let's have a happy little tree in here. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. You can create anything that makes you happy. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.

            You're meant to have fun in life. Imagination is the key to painting. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Every day I learn. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. You are only limited by your imagination. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. We'll play with clouds today. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun We need dark in order to show light. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.
